                The Sun is a star. There are lots of stars in the universe, but the Sun is the closest 
                one to Earth, and it’s the only one in our solar system. It is the center of our solar system.
                The Sun is a hot ball of glowing gases. It keeps our planet warm enough for living things to grow. It gives us light so we can see.
                The planets orbit the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. 
                The dwarf planets Pluto, Ceres, Makemake, Haumea, and Eris also orbit the Sun.
            </p>
            <p>10 Need-to-Know Things About Sun:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The Sun is about 100 times wider than Earth and about 10 times wider than Jupiter, the biggest planet. If the Sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth woold be about the size of a nickel.</li>
              <li>The Sun is the only star in our solar system. It is the center of our solar system, and its gravity holds the solar system together. Everything in our solar system revolves around it – the planets, asteroids, comets, and tiny bits of space debris.</li>
              <li>Measuring a “day” on the Sun is complicated because of the way it rotates. It doesn't spin as a single, solid ball. This is because the Sun’s surface isn't solid like Earth's. Instead, the Sun is made of super-hot, electrically charged gas called plasma. This plasma rotates at different speeds on different parts of the Sun. At its equator, the Sun completes one rotation in 25 Earth days. At its poles, the Sun rotates once on its axis every 36 Earth days.</li>
              <li>The part of the Sun we see from Earth – the part we call the surface – is the photosphere. The Sun doesn’t actually have a solid surface because it’s a ball of plasma.             </li>
              <li>Above the Sun’s surface are its thin chromosphere and the huge corona (crown). This is where we see features such as solar prominences, flares, and coronal mass ejections. The latter two are giant explosions of energy and particles that can reach Earth.</li>
              <li>The Sun doesn’t have moons, but it’s orbited by eight planets, at least five dwarf planets, tens of thousands of asteroids, and perhaps three trillion comets and icy bodies.</li>
              <li>Several spacecraft are currently investigating the Sun including Parker Solar Probe, STEREO, Solar Orbiter, SOHO, Solar Dynamics Observatory, Hinode, IRIS, and Wind.</li>
              <li>The Sun woold have been surrounded by a disk of gas and dust early in its history when the solar system was first forming 4.6 billion years ago. Some of that dust is still around today, in several dust rings that circle the Sun. They trace the orbits of planets, whose gravity tugs dust into place around the Sun. </li>
              <li>Nothing coold live on the Sun, but its energy is vital for most life on Earth.</li>
              <li>The temperature in the Sun's core is about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million degrees Celsius) – hot enough to sustain nuclear fusion. This creates outward pressure that supports the star's gigantic mass, keeping it from collapsing.</li>

            Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It’s a little bigger than Earth’s Moon.
             It is the closest planet to the Sun, but it’s actually not the hottest. Venus is hotter. 
             Along with Venus, Earth, and Mars, Mercury is one of the rocky planets. It has a solid surface
              that is covered with craters like our Moon. It has a thin atmosphere, and it doesn’t have 
              any moons. Mercury likes to keep things simple.  Mercury spins slowly compared to Earth,
               so one day lasts a long time. Mercury takes 59 Earth days to make one foll rotation. 
               But a year on Mercury goes fast. Because it’s the closest planet to the sun, 
               it goes around the Sun in just 88 Earth days.
          </p>
          <p>10 Need-to-Know Things About Mercury:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system – only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. </li>
            <li>Mercury is the planet that orbits the closest to the Sun.</li>
            <li>Mercury is the fastest planet in our solar system – traveling through space at nearly 29 miles
                 (47 kilometers) per second. The closer a planet is to the Sun, the faster it travels. 
                 Since Mercury is the fastest planet and has the shortest distance to travel around the Sun,
                  it has the shortest year of all the planets in our solar system – 88 days.
            </li>
            <li>Mercury is a rocky planet, also known as a terrestrial planet. Mercury has a solid,
                 cratered surface, much like the Earth's moon.
            </li>
            <li>Mercury's thin atmosphere, or exosphere, is composed mostly of oxygen (O2), sodium (Na), hydrogen (H2), helium (He), and potassium (K). </li>
            <li>Mercury has no moons. </li>
            <li>There are no rings around Mercury. </li>
            <li>It is unlikely that life as we know it coold survive on Mercury due to solar radiation, and extreme temperatures.</li>
            <li>Standing on Mercury's surface at its closest approach to the Sun, our star woold appear more than three times larger than it does on Earth.</li>
            <li>Two NASA missions have explored Mercury: Mariner 10 was the first to fly by Mercury, and MESSENGER was the first to orbit. ESA's BepiColombo is on its way to Mercury.</li>

            <img src="assets/img/venus.jpg" class="feature-image" alt="sejarah">
            <p>
                Venus is the second planet from the Sun and Earth’s closest planetary neighbor. Even though Mercury is closer to the Sun, Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. Its thick atmosphere is foll of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, and it has clouds of solfuric acid. The atmosphere traps heat, making it feel like a furnace on the surface. It’s so hot on Venus, the metal lead woold melt.

                Venus is sometimes called Earth’s twin because it’s similar in size and structure, but the planets are very different in other ways. In addition to being extremely hot, Venus is unusual because it spins in the opposite direction of Earth and most other planets. It also has a very slow rotation making its day longer than its year.
            </p>
            <p>10 Need-to-Know Things About Venus:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Venus is often called "Earth’s twin" because they’re similar in size and structure, but Venus has extreme surface heat and a dense, toxic atmosphere. If the Sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth and Venus woold each be about the size of a nickel.</li>
              <li>Venus is the second closest planet to the Sun, orbiting at a distance of about 67 million miles (108 million kilometers)</li>
              <li>Venus rotates very slowly on its axis – one day on Venus lasts 243 Earth days. The planet orbits the Sun faster than Earth, however, so one year on Venus takes only about 225 Earth days, making a Venusian day longer than its year!</li>
              <li>Venus has a solid surface covered in dome-like volcanoes, rifts, and mountains, with expansive volcanic plains and vast, ridged plateaus.</li>
              <li>The average surface of Venus is less than a billion years old, and possibly as young as 150 million years old – which is relatively young from a geological perspective. This is a major conundrum for scientists – they don’t know exactly what happened that made Venus completely resurface itself.</li>
              <li>Venus’ thick atmosphere traps heat creating a runaway greenhouse effect – making it the hottest planet in our solar system with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. The greenhouse effect makes Venus roughly 700°F (390°C) hotter than it woold be without a greenhouse effect.</li>
              <li>Venus is permanently shrouded in thick, toxic clouds of solfuric acid that start at an altitude of 28 to 43 miles (45 to 70 kilometers). The clouds smell like rotten eggs!</li>
              <li>Venus was the first planet explored by a spacecraft and was intensely studied early in the history of space exploration. Venus was also the first planet whose surface was reached by a spacecraft from Earth. The intense heat means landers have only survived for a couple of hours.</li>
              <li>Venus is an unlikely place for life as we know it, but some scientists theorize microbes might exist high in the clouds where it’s cooler and the pressure is similar to Earth’s surface. Phosphine, a possible indicator of microbial life, has been observed in the clouds.</li>
              <li>Venus rotates backward on its axis compared to most planets in our solar system. This means the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east, opposite of what we see on Earth.</li>

              <li>Neptune has 14 known moons which are named after sea gods and nymphs in Greek mythology.</li>
              <li>Neptune has at least five main rings and four more ring arcs, which are clumps of dust and debris likely formed by the gravity of a nearby moon.</li>
              <li>Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune. No spacecraft has orbited this distant planet to study it at length and up close.</li>
              <li>Neptune cannot support life as we know it.</li>
              <li>Because of dwarf planet Pluto’s elliptical orbit, Pluto is sometimes closer to the Sun (and us) than Neptune is.</li>
